    "has never been observed, however it is a fundamental ingredient for the studies of lepton universality in semileptonic $\\Lambda_b^0$ decays. Using a sample of LHCb data prepared with observables useful for discriminating signal from background events, the student is required to perform a signal selection separating interesting events from background using multivariate analysis techniques, including Deep Neural Networks. After having selected the best figure-of-merit able to successfully solve the problem, a detailed study of the effect on the multivariate analysis due to different fractions of the total sample used for training the network is required (minimizing the overtraining if present). The performances of the sample selection will be studied as a function of the different regularization algorithms used. After this the sample selection will be performed with the Deep Neural Network, where an optimization of the number of neurons, the activation function type and the cost function is required.\n",

The list is transformed into a grid where all the possible hyperparameters combination are explored and for each point of the grid the score is computed. In our case we used as score the mean accuracy obtained on the test set during a 4-fold cross validation trianing, namely we divide the training set in 4 sub-sets and train the Network using one sub-set as validation and the others as training set.
